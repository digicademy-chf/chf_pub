The extension provides a data model for data of stereotypical publications,
such as printed volumes and academic blogs, as part of the Cultural Heritage
Framework (CHF). The central resource equals either a book series or a blog.
It may contain multiple volumes which, in turn, contain sections and/or
essays. These could be new publications or retrodigitised ones. To model a
blog instead, essays may be added directly to the resource. Other records
may be connected to volumes through a dedicated volume relation.
