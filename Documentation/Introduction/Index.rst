The extension allows you to build traditional publications in your TYPO3
project. This can be a book series, an individual volume, or a blog. The
extension is part of the Cultural Heritage Framework (CHF), which provides
additional functionality such as agents, bibliographies, and various
additional data models.

..  attention::

    The extension is not final yet. A lot of things may still change over the
    coming months.
